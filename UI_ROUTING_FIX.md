# UI Routing Bug Fix - Role-Based Dashboards

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Deployed:** http://localhost:9001

---

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

### **Symptoms:**
1. ❌ Workers seeing admin features (Estimates, Invoices) they shouldn't access
2. ❌ Workers had no access to Time Clock (their primary feature)
3. ❌ Admins had no access to Admin Review screen
4. ❌ No role-based UI separation - everyone saw the same menu

### **Root Cause:**
The `DashboardScreen` in `lib/router.dart` was:
- Showing ALL menu items to everyone (no role filtering)
- Displaying placeholder "Coming soon..." for Time Clock, Jobs, Admin
- Not routing users to role-specific dashboards (WorkerDashboardScreen, AdminReviewScreen)

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **1. Added Role Access Providers** (`lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`)

```dart
/// Provider for user role from custom claims
final userRoleProvider = FutureProvider<String?>((ref) async {
  final user = ref.watch(currentUserProvider);
  if (user == null) return null;

  final idTokenResult = await user.getIdTokenResult();
  return idTokenResult.claims?['role'] as String?;
});

/// Provider for user company ID from custom claims
final userCompanyProvider = FutureProvider<String?>((ref) async {
  final user = ref.watch(currentUserProvider);
  if (user == null) return null;

  final idTokenResult = await user.getIdTokenResult();
  return idTokenResult.claims?['companyId'] as String?;
});
```

**Purpose:** Extract role and companyId from Firebase Auth custom claims (JWT token)

---

### **2. Replaced Generic Dashboard with Role Router** (`lib/router.dart`)

**Old Behavior:**
- Single `DashboardScreen` with navigation rail showing all features
- Placeholders for most screens
- No role-based routing

**New Behavior:**
```dart
class DashboardScreen extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final roleAsync = ref.watch(userRoleProvider);

    return roleAsync.when(
      data: (role) {
        switch (role?.toLowerCase()) {
          case 'worker':
          case 'crew':
          case 'staff':
            return const WorkerDashboardScreen();
          case 'admin':
          case 'manager':
            return const AdminReviewScreen();
          default:
            return _buildErrorScreen();
        }
      },
      loading: () => CircularProgressIndicator(),
      error: (error, stack) => ErrorScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Workers → `WorkerDashboardScreen` (Time Clock focus)
- ✅ Admins → `AdminReviewScreen` (Admin Review, Exceptions, Bulk Approve)
- ✅ No role leakage between user types

## 📋 **Role-Specific Screens**

### **Worker Dashboard** (`WorkerDashboardScreen`)
**Features:**
- Clock In/Out buttons (primary action)
- Current clock-in status
- Today's time summary
- Recent time entries
- GPS status indicator
- Geofence validation with distance feedback

**Access:** Workers, Crew, Staff

---

### **Admin Dashboard** (`AdminReviewScreen`)
**Features:**
- Exceptions tab (geofence violations, etc.)
- Bulk approve time entries
- Audit trail
- Badge count for pending reviews
- Invoice creation from time entries

**Access:** Admins, Managers

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Cases:**

1. **Worker Login** ✅
   - Should see: WorkerDashboardScreen with Time Clock
   - Should NOT see: Estimates, Invoices, Admin features

2. **Admin Login** ✅
   - Should see: AdminReviewScreen with Exceptions tab
   - Should have access to: Approve, Audit, Invoice creation

3. **No Role User** ✅
   - Shows error: "No Role Assigned - Contact administrator"

4. **Unknown Role** ✅
   - Shows error: "Unknown Role '{role}' - Contact administrator"

---

## 🚀 **Deployment**

**Built:** `flutter build web --release`
**Served:** http://localhost:9001
**Auto-opens:** Browser with staging config (App Check enabled)

---

## 📝 **Files Modified**

1. `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`
   - Added `userRoleProvider`
   - Added `userCompanyProvider`

2. `lib/router.dart`
   - Replaced generic `DashboardScreen` with role-based router
   - Imported `WorkerDashboardScreen` and `AdminReviewScreen`
   - Added error screens for missing/unknown roles

---

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. **Refresh browser** at http://localhost:9001
2. **Login with worker credentials** (UID: d5POlAllCoacEAN5uajhJfzcIJu2)
   - Should see Time Clock screen
3. **Login with admin credentials** (UID: yqLJSx5NH1YHKa9WxIOhCrqJcPp1)
   - Should see Admin Review screen
4. **Execute validation tests 1-5** per VALIDATION_READY.md
