## What is a how-to guide?

How-to guides are practical instructions that assume you have some knowledge. They:

- Focus on solving specific problems
- Assume basic familiarity with the project
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Don't explain concepts (see [explanations](../explanation/) for that)

## Next steps

- Start with [tutorials](../tutorials/) if you're new
- Read [explanations](../explanation/) to understand concepts
- Consult the [reference](../reference/) for detailed API documentation
