## Security Enhancements

### 1. App Check Enforcement (RISK-SEC-003 Mitigation)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

All callable Cloud Functions now enforce Firebase App Check with replay attack protection:

| Function | Location | App Check | Replay Protection |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| `createLead` | `leads/createLead.ts` | ✅ | ✅ `consumeAppCheckToken: true` |
| `markPaidManual` | `payments/markPaidManual.ts` | ✅ | ✅ `consumeAppCheckToken: true` |
| `markPaymentPaid` (legacy) | `index.ts` | ✅ | ✅ `consumeAppCheckToken: true` |
| `clockIn` | `index.ts` | ✅ | ✅ `consumeAppCheckToken: true` |
| `initializeFlags` | `ops/initializeFlags.ts` | ✅ | ✅ `consumeAppCheckToken: true` |

**Implementation Details:**
- All functions use `.runWith({ enforceAppCheck: true, consumeAppCheckToken: true })`
- Runtime validation added for defense in depth via `if (!context.app)` checks
- Tokens are consumed to prevent replay attacks

**Security Benefits:**
- Only legitimate app instances can call functions
- Protection against bot abuse and automated attacks
- Single-use tokens prevent replay attacks
- Additional layer of defense beyond authentication

---

### 2. Payment Amount Validation

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Changes Made:**
- Added payment amount validation in `markPaidManual` function
- Validates that payment amount matches invoice total before processing
- Added amount validation in legacy `markPaymentPaid` function
- Updated `ManualPaymentSchema` in `schemas/index.ts` to include optional amount field

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Validate payment amount matches invoice total
const invoiceTotal = invoiceData.total || invoiceData.amount || 0;
if (validatedPayment.amount !== invoiceTotal) {
  functions.logger.warn('Payment amount mismatch', {
    invoiceId: validatedPayment.invoiceId,
    paymentAmount: validatedPayment.amount,
    invoiceTotal,
  });
  throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
    'invalid-argument',
    `Payment amount (${validatedPayment.amount}) does not match invoice total (${invoiceTotal})`
  );
}
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Prevents accidental overpayments or underpayments
- Ensures data integrity between invoices and payments
- Provides audit trail of mismatches via structured logging

---

### 3. Firestore Rules Hardening (RISK-SEC-002 Mitigation)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Changes Made:**
- Protected invoice `amount` and `total` fields from client modification
- Enhanced Firestore rules to prevent client tampering with payment-related fields
- Added comprehensive security header documentation

**Updated Rule:**
```javascript
// Block client writes that include sensitive payment fields
// These fields can only be set server-side via markPaymentPaid function
// RISK-SEC-002 mitigation: Prevent client tampering with invoice amounts
allow update: if isAdmin() && 
               !request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
                 .hasAny(['paid', 'paidAt', 'total', 'amount']);
```

**Protected Fields:**
- `paid` - Payment status flag
- `paidAt` - Payment timestamp
- `total` - Invoice total amount
- `amount` - Invoice amount

**Security Benefits:**
- Prevents malicious clients from modifying invoice amounts
- Server-side recalculation ensures data integrity
- Audit trail preserved (invoices cannot be deleted)

---

### 4. Admin-Only Access Control

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Changes Made:**
- Added admin-only enforcement to `initializeFlags` function
- All payment-related functions verify admin role before processing
- Consistent role checking across all sensitive operations

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Admin-only operation for security
const admin = await import('firebase-admin');
const db = admin.firestore();
const userDoc = await db.collection('users').doc(context.auth.uid).get();

if (!userDoc.exists || userDoc.data()?.role !== 'admin') {
  throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
    'permission-denied',
    'Only admins can initialize feature flags'
  );
}
```

---

### 5. Documentation Updates

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Security.md Updates:**
- Documented all protected functions with App Check status
- Added security benefits section explaining replay protection
- Updated function list with enforcement details
- Added App Check setup instructions

**Firestore.rules Documentation:**
- Added comprehensive security header
- Documented App Check enforcement strategy
- Explained multi-layer security approach

**Storage.rules Documentation:**
- Added App Check notes
- Clarified enforcement at Cloud Functions level

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### Phase 3 Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| All lint errors fixed | ✅ | `npm run lint` passes with 0 errors |
| Functions build passes | ✅ | `npm run build` completes successfully |
| No type 'any' usage without justification | ✅ | Grep search shows 0 unjustified uses |

## Security Risk Mitigation Status

| Risk ID | Description | Severity | Status | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|------------|
| RISK-SEC-002 | Client Tampering (Invoice Amounts) | Critical | ✅ Mitigated | Firestore rules + server validation |

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1)

The following items are documented as future enhancements but not required for V1:

1. **Rate Limiting** - Implement per-IP or per-user rate limiting using Firebase Extensions
2. **Captcha Verification** - Implement Google reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha in createLead
3. **Email Notifications** - Send notifications to admins on lead submission
4. **Partial Payments** - Support for invoice partial payments
5. **Analytics Integration** - Log payment and lead events to Firebase Analytics

---

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
1. Enable App Check in Firebase Console
2. Configure providers:
   - Android: Play Integrity API
   - iOS: DeviceCheck or App Attest
   - Web: reCAPTCHA Enterprise

### Debug Tokens
For development/staging environments, register debug tokens in Firebase Console:
```bash
# Generate debug token UUID
uuidgen

# Add to Firebase Console → App Check → Debug Tokens
```

### Deployment Command
```bash
# Deploy functions with new security rules
firebase deploy --only functions,firestore:rules,storage
```

---

## Conclusion

All Phase 3 functional hardening requirements have been successfully implemented. The application now has comprehensive security controls in place:

- ✅ Multi-layer security (App Check + Auth + Authorization + Rules)
- ✅ Protection against client tampering and replay attacks
- ✅ Server-side validation of all critical operations
- ✅ Proper data access controls via Firestore rules
- ✅ Audit trail preservation
- ✅ Type-safe, validated inputs across all functions

The codebase is now hardened and ready for V1 deployment with enterprise-grade security controls.
