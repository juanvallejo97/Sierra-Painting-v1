# Enterprise Remediation Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the Enterprise Remediation Plan for the D'Sierra Painting Application, ensuring all CI checks pass and the codebase meets enterprise standards.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Items

#### 1. Firestore Rules Testing Infrastructure
- **Created**: `firestore-tests/` directory with Node.js test harness
- **Package**: `firestore-tests/package.json` with @firebase/rules-unit-testing
- **Tests**: `firestore-tests/rules.spec.mjs` with comprehensive security tests
- **Coverage**: Tests authentication, RBAC, org scoping, deny-by-default policies
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/rules-test.yml` updated to use new infrastructure

#### 2. Smoke Test Infrastructure  
- **Created**: `tool/smoke/smoke.dart` for CI artifact generation
- **Existing**: `integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart` (already present)
- **Scripts**: Added `smoke` command to `package.json` and `Makefile`
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/smoke.yml` updated with correct job names

#### 3. CI/CD Workflow Updates
All workflow job names updated to match expected check names:
- ✅ `Code Quality Checks / Code Quality & Lint Enforcement`
- ✅ `Flutter CI / Analyze and Test Flutter`
- ✅ `Security - Firestore Rules / rules`
- ✅ `Security - Prevent JSON Credentials / Check for JSON Service Account Keys`
- ✅ `Smoke Tests / Mobile App Smoke Tests`
- ✅ `Smoke Tests / Smoke Test Summary`

#### 4. Security Enhancements
- **Created**: `SECURITY.md` with comprehensive secrets handling guidelines
- **Created**: `secrets/_examples/` directory with placeholder templates
- **Updated**: `.gitignore` to prevent service account key commits
- **Patterns**: Added exclusions for `*service-account*.json`, `*credentials.json`, etc.

#### 5. Developer Tools
- **Created**: `Makefile` with convenience commands:
  - `make analyze` - Run Flutter analyzer
  - `make test` - Run tests with coverage
  - `make format` - Format Dart code
  - `make smoke` - Generate smoke test artifacts
  - `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- **Updated**: `package.json` with `smoke` script

#### 6. Documentation
- **Updated**: `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes
- **Created**: This implementation summary document
- **Existing**: All ADRs and architecture docs remain valid

## Firestore Rules Tests

### Test Coverage

The `firestore-tests/rules.spec.mjs` file includes comprehensive tests for:

1. **Users Collection** (`/users/{uid}`)
   - Anonymous cannot read/write
   - Users can read/write own profile
   - Users cannot read other profiles (unless admin)
   - Admins can read any profile
   - Users cannot elevate their own role

2. **Jobs Collection** (`/jobs/{jobId}`)
   - Schema validation (orgId, ownerId, status required)
   - Org membership validation
   - Owner-based access control
   - Admin override access

3. **Payments Collection** (`/payments/{paymentId}`)
   - Server-side only (users and admins cannot write)
   - Users can read their own payments
   - Admins can read all payments

4. **Leads Collection** (`/leads/{leadId}`)
   - Server-side only creation (Cloud Functions)
   - Admins can read leads
   - Regular users cannot create leads

5. **Default Deny-by-Default**
   - Anonymous users blocked from all unmapped collections
   - Authenticated users blocked from unmapped collections

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd firestore-tests
npm install

# Start Firestore emulator (in separate terminal)
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# Run tests
npm test
```

### CI Integration

The rules tests run automatically on:
- Pull requests that modify `firestore.rules` or `firestore-tests/**`
- Pushes to main that modify the same files

## Smoke Tests

### Mobile App Smoke Tests

Located at `integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart`, these tests verify:
- App launches within performance budget (< 3000ms in CI)
- Basic UI renders (MaterialApp/Scaffold present)
- Navigation works without crashes
- Frame rendering performance (< 100ms in CI)

### Backend Health Checks

Located at `functions/test/smoke/health_test.ts`, these tests verify:
- Health endpoint returns 200 status
- Response includes version, timestamp, status
- Response time < 200ms
- Correct response structure

### Running Smoke Tests

```bash
# Mobile smoke tests
flutter test integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart

# Generate smoke artifact
dart run tool/smoke/smoke.dart
# or
make smoke
# or
npm run smoke

# Backend health tests
cd functions
npm test -- test/smoke/health_test.ts
```

## Security Policy

### Secrets Handling

**Never commit**:
- `*service-account*.json`
- `*-service-account*.json`
- `firebase-adminsdk-*.json`
- `*credentials.json`
- Any file with `private_key` or `"type": "service_account"`

### CI/CD Security

All deployment workflows use **OIDC Workload Identity Federation** instead of service account keys.

Required workflow permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
```

### Automated Security Checks

1. **JSON Credentials Check**: Prevents service account keys in PRs
2. **Firestore Rules Tests**: Validates security rules
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Checks for vulnerabilities

## Dependency Management

### Current Dependencies

The project uses:
- **State Management**: Riverpod (not Provider package alone)
- **Linting**: very_good_analysis (stricter than flutter_lints)
- **Firebase**: Latest versions of all Firebase packages
- **Testing**: flutter_test, integration_test, mockito

### Dependency Overrides

Two overrides are **justified and necessary**:
1. `material_color_utilities: 0.5.0` - Matches Flutter SDK's integration_test
2. `analyzer: ^6.4.1` - Required by build_runner and dart_code_metrics

These are documented in `pubspec.yaml` and `AUDIT_REPORT.md`.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Workflow Summary

| Workflow | Jobs | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Code Quality Checks | Code Quality & Lint Enforcement | Format, analyze, metrics |
| Flutter CI | Analyze and Test Flutter | Analyze, test, build APK |
| Security - Firestore Rules | rules | Test security rules |
| Security - Prevent JSON Credentials | Check for JSON Service Account Keys | Prevent credential leaks |
| Smoke Tests | Mobile App Smoke Tests, Backend Health Check, Smoke Test Summary | Fast health checks |

### Local Development Workflow

```bash
# Format code
make format
# or
dart format .

# Analyze code
make analyze
# or
flutter analyze

# Run tests
make test
# or
flutter test --coverage

# Run smoke tests
make smoke
# or
dart run tool/smoke/smoke.dart

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
# or
flutter clean
```

## What Changed from Original Setup

### New Files

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All infrastructure code committed
2. ⏳ Wait for CI to run on PR
3. ⏳ Verify all checks pass
4. ⏳ Address any CI-specific issues that arise
5. ✅ Merge when all checks are green

## Troubleshooting

### If Firestore Rules Tests Fail

1. Check emulator started successfully (workflow logs)
2. Verify `firestore.rules` syntax is valid
3. Check test expectations match actual rules
4. Ensure Node.js dependencies installed correctly

### If Smoke Tests Fail

1. Check app launches successfully
2. Verify Firebase configuration is present
3. Check for breaking changes in main.dart
4. Ensure integration_test dependencies are installed

### If Code Quality Fails

1. Run `dart format .` locally
2. Run `flutter analyze` and fix issues
3. Check for unused imports or code
4. Verify all public APIs have documentation

### If JSON Credentials Check Fails

1. Search for `private_key` in JSON files
2. Check for service account filename patterns
3. Remove any accidentally committed keys
4. Add files to `.gitignore` if needed
