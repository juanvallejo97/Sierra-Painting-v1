# Tutorials

Tutorials are learning-oriented lessons that take you through a series of steps to complete a
project. They help you learn by doing.

## Available tutorials

- [Getting started with Sierra Painting](getting-started.md) - Set up your development environment
  and run your first build

## What is a tutorial?

Tutorials are lessons that guide you through a complete project from start to finish. They:

- Focus on learning by doing
- Are safe spaces where you can't make mistakes
- Use a hands-on approach with clear outcomes
- Don't explain concepts in depth (see [explanations](../explanation/) for that)

## Next steps

- After completing tutorials, check out [how-to guides](../how-to/) for specific tasks
- Read [explanations](../explanation/) to understand concepts in depth
- Consult the [reference](../reference/) for API documentation
