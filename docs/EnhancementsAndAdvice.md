- Add input sanitization for XSS prevention
- Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
- Rate limit form submissions

**Impact**: Security, better UX (instant feedback), reduced function calls

**Validation Rules**:
```dart
// lib/core/utils/validators.dart
class Validators {
  static String? email(String? value);
  static String? phone(String? value);
  static String? required(String? value);
  static String? positiveNumber(String? value);
  static String? checkNumber(String? value); // Check # format
}
```

---

### 14. Webhook Idempotency Design
**Current State**: Basic idempotency in markPaymentPaid  
**Enhancement**:
- Standardize idempotency pattern across all functions
- Use `idempotency` subcollection with TTL
