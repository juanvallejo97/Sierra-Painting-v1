# Sprint V3 - Lead Management & Scheduling

**Goal**: Enable lead capture and basic job scheduling.

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks

## Stories in Sprint

### Epic D: Lead Management & Scheduling
- ðŸ“‹ **D1**: Public Lead Form (Est: M, Risk: L)
- ðŸ“‹ **D2**: Admin Review Lead (Est: M, Risk: M)
- ðŸ“‹ **D3**: Schedule Lite (Basic Job Creation) (Est: M, Risk: M)

## Cut Line Strategy

### Must Ship
- D1, D2, D3: Complete lead-to-job workflow

### Can Defer if Tight
- Advanced scheduling features (drag-and-drop, calendar view)

## Dependencies

```
V2 Complete â”€â”€> D1 (Public Lead Form)
                â””â”€â”€> D2 (Review Lead)
                     â””â”€â”€> D3 (Schedule Job)

D3 â”€â”€> B3 (Jobs Today integration)
```

## Acceptance Criteria (Sprint)

### Lead Capture (D1)
**GIVEN** a potential customer visits our website  
**WHEN** they submit the lead form  
**THEN** lead is created and admin is notified

### Lead Workflow (D2, D3)
**GIVEN** a new lead is submitted  
**WHEN** admin reviews and qualifies it  
**THEN** admin can convert it to a scheduled job  
**AND** assigned painters see it in Jobs Today

## Performance Targets

| Operation | Target (P95) |
