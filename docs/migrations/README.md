# Migration Guides

This directory contains migration guides for breaking changes in dependency updates.

## Purpose

When updating dependencies that introduce breaking changes, create a migration guide here to:
- Document all breaking changes
- Provide step-by-step migration instructions
- Include code examples (before/after)
- Specify rollback procedures
- Track migration progress

## Naming Convention

Use the following format for migration guide filenames:

```
Migration-YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md
```

Examples:
- `Migration-2024-01-15-firebase-functions-v5.md`
- `Migration-2024-02-20-flutter-3-16-upgrade.md`
- `Migration-2024-03-10-riverpod-v3-migration.md`

## Migration Guide Template

When creating a new migration guide, use this template:

```markdown
# Migration: [Package Name] [Old Version] â†’ [New Version]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** [Planned / In Progress / Completed]  
**Owner:** [Developer Name]

## Summary

Brief description of what's being updated and why.

3. ...

## Impact Assessment

### Affected Areas
- List code areas affected
- Estimate effort required
- Identify risks

### Dependencies
- Other packages that need updating
- Potential conflicts

## Migration Steps

### 1. Preparation
- [ ] Back up current state
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Review upstream documentation
- [ ] Plan testing strategy

### 2. Code Changes

#### Before
\`\`\`dart
// Old code example
\`\`\`

#### After
\`\`\`dart
// New code example with explanation
\`\`\`

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Update unit tests
- [ ] Update integration tests
- [ ] Test in local environment
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Smoke test critical paths

### 4. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor for 7 days

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Specific rollback steps
2. Commands to run
3. Expected recovery time

```bash
# Example rollback commands
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Verification

How to verify the migration was successful:
