## Overview

This document defines the security scanning policy for the Sierra Painting application. The policy covers automated vulnerability scanning, dependency management, license compliance, and remediation procedures.

**Objectives**:
- Identify security vulnerabilities before they reach production
- Ensure dependencies are up-to-date and free of known CVEs
- Maintain license compliance for all third-party dependencies
- Provide clear remediation timelines based on severity
- Enable continuous security monitoring and improvement

**Scope**: All codebases, dependencies, and infrastructure configurations for Sierra Painting (Flutter app, Cloud Functions, CI/CD pipelines).

## Scanning Schedule

### Automated Scans

| Scan Type | Frequency | Trigger | Timeout |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| NPM Audit | On every PR + Weekly | PR to main/staging | 10 min |
| Dart/Flutter Audit | On every PR + Weekly | PR to main/staging | 10 min |
| CodeQL (SAST) | On every PR + Weekly | PR to main/staging | 20 min |
| Secret Scanning | On every PR + Weekly | PR to main/staging | 10 min |
| License Compliance | On every PR + Weekly | PR to main/staging | 10 min |
| Dependency Review | On every PR | PR only | 5 min |

### Manual Scans

- **Pre-Release**: Full security scan before each production deployment
- **Post-Incident**: Comprehensive scan after any security incident
- **Quarterly Review**: Deep dive security audit every 3 months

---

## Scan Types

### 1. NPM Audit (Dependency Vulnerability Scan)

**Tool**: `npm audit`
**Target**: Root `package.json` + Functions `package.json`

**What It Checks**:
- Known CVEs in npm dependencies
- Transitive dependency vulnerabilities
- Outdated packages with security patches available

**Output**:
- JSON report uploaded as GitHub artifact
- Summary in PR comment or workflow summary
- Exit code 1 if vulnerabilities found (fails workflow)

**Remediation**:
```bash
# Automatic fix (may break things)
npm audit fix

# Manual fix (safer)
npm audit fix --force
npm test  # Verify no regressions

# For specific package
npm update <package-name>
```

### 2. Dart/Flutter Dependency Audit

**Tool**: `flutter pub outdated`
**Target**: Root `pubspec.yaml`

**What It Checks**:
- Outdated Dart/Flutter packages
- Null-safety compliance
- Available security patches

**Output**:
- JSON report uploaded as GitHub artifact
- Summary in workflow output
- Warnings for packages >3 months outdated

**Remediation**:
```bash
# Check for updates
flutter pub outdated

# Update all
flutter pub upgrade

# Update specific package
flutter pub upgrade <package_name>

# Verify no regressions
flutter test
```

### 3. CodeQL (Static Application Security Testing)

**Tool**: GitHub CodeQL
**Target**: JavaScript/TypeScript code in Cloud Functions

**What It Checks**:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Path traversal
- Insecure randomness
- Hardcoded credentials
- Unsafe regex
- Security-extended and security-and-quality queries

**Output**:
- SARIF report uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Alerts in GitHub Security dashboard
- Fails workflow if high/critical issues found

**Remediation**:
- Review alerts in GitHub Security â†’ Code scanning
- Fix issues per CodeQL recommendations
- Re-run scan to verify fix
- Suppress false positives with justification

### 4. Secret Scanning (Gitleaks)

**Tool**: Gitleaks
**Target**: All files in git history

**What It Checks**:
- API keys (Firebase, Stripe, etc.)
- Database credentials
- Private keys (SSH, PGP)
- OAuth tokens
- AWS access keys
- Generic secrets (passwords, tokens)

**Output**:
- SARIF report uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Fails workflow immediately if secrets detected
- No public exposure (secrets not logged)

**Remediation** (CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required):
1. **Rotate Compromised Credentials**: Invalidate the exposed secret immediately
2. **Remove from Git History**: Use `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
3. **Add to .gitignore**: Prevent future commits
4. **Use Environment Variables**: Store secrets in GitHub Secrets or Firebase Config
5. **Audit Access Logs**: Check if secret was accessed by unauthorized parties
6. **Incident Report**: File incident report per incident response procedure

**Example Remediation**:
```bash
# Rotate Firebase API key
firebase projects:list
firebase login
# Generate new key in Firebase Console

# Remove from git history (BE CAREFUL!)
git filter-repo --path path/to/file --invert-paths

# Add to .gitignore
echo "firebase-service-account-*.json" >> .gitignore

# Use environment variable instead
export FIREBASE_API_KEY="..."
```

### 5. License Compliance

**Tool**: `license-checker`
**Target**: All npm dependencies

**What It Checks**:
- License types for all dependencies
- Prohibited licenses (GPL, AGPL, LGPL)
- Missing or ambiguous licenses

**Allowed Licenses**:
- MIT
- Apache-2.0
- BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause
- ISC
- 0BSD
- CC0-1.0
- Unlicense
- WTFPL

**Prohibited Licenses**:
- GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0 (requires source disclosure)
- AGPL-3.0 (requires network source disclosure)
- LGPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0 (linking restrictions)

**Output**:
- JSON report with all licenses
- Summary table in workflow output
- Fails workflow if prohibited license found

**Remediation**:
```bash
# Find prohibited license
license-checker --json | jq '.[] | select(.licenses | test("GPL"))'

# Option 1: Find alternative package
npm uninstall <package>
npm install <alternative-package>

# Option 2: Seek legal approval (rare)
# Contact legal team for exception request
```

### 6. Dependency Review (GitHub Native)

**Tool**: GitHub Dependency Review Action
**Target**: Pull requests only

**What It Checks**:
- New vulnerabilities introduced in PR
- Dependency version changes
- License changes
- Security advisories

**Output**:
- Comment on PR with detailed diff
- Blocks merge if high/critical vulnerabilities introduced

**Remediation**:
- Update dependency to patched version
- Remove dependency if not needed
- Request review from security team if no patch available

## Vulnerability Severity Levels

Based on CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Color | Examples |
|----------|------------|-------|----------|
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | ðŸ”´ Red | Remote code execution, SQL injection in production |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | ðŸŸ  Orange | Authentication bypass, XSS in production |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | Information disclosure, CSRF |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | ðŸŸ¢ Green | Minor information leak, low-impact DoS |
| **Informational** | 0.0 | âšª White | Best practice violation, code smell |

## Dependency Management

### Update Strategy

**Patch Versions** (e.g., 1.2.3 â†’ 1.2.4): Auto-merge if tests pass
**Minor Versions** (e.g., 1.2.3 â†’ 1.3.0): Review + manual merge after QA
**Major Versions** (e.g., 1.2.3 â†’ 2.0.0): Schedule for next sprint, comprehensive testing

### Dependabot Configuration

- **Schedule**: Weekly for all ecosystems
- **Pull Request Limit**: 5 per ecosystem
- **Grouping**: Related packages grouped into single PR
- **Auto-merge**: Patch versions only, if tests pass

### Manual Review Checklist

Before merging dependency update PR:
- [ ] All CI checks passed (tests, lint, build)
- [ ] No breaking changes in CHANGELOG
- [ ] E2E smoke test passed
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] License remains compatible
