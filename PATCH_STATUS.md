## ‚úÖ P0 - CRITICAL (Completed)

### 1. ‚úÖ Secrets: .env Bundling Prevention
**Status**: FIXED
**Commits**: `49dddde`, `c8a4f2e` (new CI guard)

**Completed Actions**:
- ‚úÖ Removed `.env` from pubspec.yaml assets
- ‚úÖ Created CI guard workflow (`.github/workflows/guard-env.yml`)
- ‚úÖ Verified .gitignore blocks `.env`
- ‚úÖ Added security warnings in pubspec.yaml comments

**Verification**:
- ‚úÖ No existing build artifacts found (Windows dev environment)
- ‚úÖ CI guard will prevent future bundling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **ACTION REQUIRED**: If ANY builds were ever deployed with `.env` bundled:
  1. Check distribution channels (Play Store, App Store, Firebase Hosting)
  2. Rotate ALL credentials immediately
  3. Document in `docs/SECURITY_INCIDENTS.md`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] CI guard passes on this branch
- [x] `.env` not in pubspec.yaml assets
- [x] `.env` in .gitignore
- [ ] **Manual check**: Verify no deployed builds contain .env (if deployed)

  - Invoices (company + status + date, company + date)
  - Timeclock entries (user + date, company + user + date)
  - Audit logs (company + timestamp, action + timestamp)
  - Users (company + role)

**Next Steps**:
```bash
# Deploy indexes to Firebase
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes --project sierra-painting-staging
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes --project sierra-painting-prod

# Monitor index build status
# Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Indexes
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

### 8. ‚úÖ CI Test Timeouts
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH
**Time Taken**: 4 hours

**Issue**: `flutter test --coverage` timed out after 3 minutes; widget tests crashed with `[core/no-app]` error.

**Root Cause**:
- Crashlytics accessed before Firebase init in test mode
- Test harness attempted Firebase initialization causing platform channel errors
- Test detection (`isUnderTest`) wasn't reliable without `--dart-define` flag
- Pre-commit hook used incorrect `flutter format` command

**Completed Actions**:
- ‚úÖ Created `lib/core/env/build_flags.dart` with enhanced test detection
- ‚úÖ Guarded all Crashlytics access behind `isUnderTest` flag in `main.dart`
- ‚úÖ Removed Firebase initialization from `test/test_harness.dart`
- ‚úÖ Added `--dart-define=FLUTTER_TEST=true` to test runner scripts
- ‚úÖ Fixed integration test arg passing in PowerShell (`cmd /c`)
- ‚úÖ Stabilized `smoke_login_test.dart` (removed Firebase setup, used `pump` vs `pumpAndSettle`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed pre-commit hook: `dart format` (not `flutter format`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed `router_redirect_test.dart` (aligned with working auth test pattern)
- ‚úÖ Created CI workflows: `tests.yml` and `guard-widget-tests.yml`
- ‚úÖ Added Firebase emulator config with proper async handling

**Files Created**:
- `lib/core/env/build_flags.dart` - Test mode detection
- `lib/core/firebase_emulators.dart` - Emulator connection helper
- `scripts/run_test_local_temp.ps1` - Windows test runner with TEMP isolation
- `scripts/run_integration_with_emulators.ps1` - Integration test runner
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` - CI test workflow with coverage gate
- `.github/workflows/guard-widget-tests.yml` - Prevents Firebase in widget tests
- `integration_test/bootstrap_test.dart` - Firebase emulator smoke test

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/main.dart` - Consolidated Crashlytics guards
- `test/flutter_test_config.dart` - Minimal harness (no Firebase)
- `test/test_harness.dart` - Removed Firebase init
- `test/smoke_login_test.dart` - Stabilized with pump() instead of pumpAndSettle()
- `test/widget/router_redirect_test.dart` - Fixed failing test
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Fixed format command
- `.gitignore` - Added test temp directories

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ 68/68 widget tests passing (was 67/68 with [core/no-app] crashes)
- ‚úÖ No platform channel errors in test mode
- ‚úÖ Tests complete in <10 seconds (was timing out at 3+ minutes)
- ‚úÖ Coverage file generates successfully
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hook works correctly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] All tests complete under 2 minutes
- [x] Coverage file generated (`coverage/lcov.info`)
- [x] CI test workflows created
- [x] Widget tests isolated from Firebase (no platform channels)
- [ ] **CI verification**: Awaiting push to verify workflows run successfully
