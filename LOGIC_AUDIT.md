# Logic Fault & Recurring Bug Audit Report
**Sierra Painting Flutter Application**
**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Audit Type**: Comprehensive Logic Analysis
**Scope**: Full-stack (Frontend, Backend, Firestore Rules, Tests)

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive logic fault audit was conducted on the Sierra Painting codebase following the UX Part 2 implementation (invoices, employees, assignments, worker schedule). The audit identified **12 critical logic hotspots** with a combined risk score of 216 points. The most severe issues include missing Firestore security rules for new collections, floating-point precision errors in financial calculations, and mixed router API usage causing navigation inconsistencies.

### Top 5 Prioritized Issues
1. **Missing Firestore Security Rules** (Score: 27) - Critical security vulnerability
2. **Floating Point Precision in Invoices** (Score: 24) - Financial accuracy at risk
3. **Mixed Router API Usage** (Score: 18) - Navigation state corruption
4. **Missing Test Coverage for New Features** (Score: 18) - Unvalidated business logic
5. **Admin Dashboard Loading Issues** (Score: 18) - Recurring production incidents

**Immediate Action Required**: Implement Firestore rules for `employees` and `assignments` collections before any production deployment.

## Recurring Bug Patterns

### 1. Admin Dashboard Loading Issues (5+ incidents)
```
Git history shows repeated fixes:
- "fix(admin): dashboard loading state race condition"
- "fix(admin): dashboard providers not refreshing"
- "hotfix: admin dashboard blank screen on first load"
- "fix: admin dashboard showing stale data after logout"
- "emergency fix: admin dashboard infinite loading"
```

**Root Cause**: Complex provider dependency chains with improper invalidation sequencing.

### 2. Navigation State Corruption
Mixed usage of `Navigator.pushNamed()` and `context.go()` causes:
- Lost navigation stack on web refresh
- Back button inconsistencies
- Deep link failures
- Route guard bypasses

### 3. Financial Calculation Errors
```dart
// Found in invoice_create_screen.dart
final taxRate = double.tryParse(_taxRateController.text) ?? 0.0;
// No validation: can be negative or >100%
final tax = subtotal * (taxRate / 100);
// Floating point errors accumulate
```

## Detailed Findings by Area

### Frontend (Flutter/Riverpod)

#### 1. Invoice Calculation Logic
**Location**: `lib/features/invoices/presentation/invoice_create_screen.dart`
- **Issue**: Using `double` for monetary calculations
- **Impact**: Rounding errors, incorrect totals
- **Evidence**: Lines 142-156, 238-252
- **Fix**: Use `Decimal` package or integer cents

#### 2. LoggerService Implementation
**Location**: `lib/core/services/logger_service.dart`
- **Issue**: 14 print statements bypass intended logging
- **Impact**: No log aggregation in production
- **Evidence**: Lines 11, 14, 20, 23, 29, 32, 38, 41, 47, 50, 56, 59, 65, 68
- **Fix**: Implement proper logger (e.g., logger package)

#### 3. Mixed Router Patterns
**Files affected**: 11 locations across codebase
- **Issue**: Mixing `Navigator.pushNamed()` with `go_router`
- **Impact**: Broken navigation stack, lost state
- **Fix**: Migrate fully to go_router

### Backend (Cloud Functions)

#### 1. Empty Error Handlers
**Location**: `functions/src/scripts/create_user.js`, `validate_tokens.js`
- **Issue**: Empty catch blocks swallow errors
- **Impact**: Silent failures in user creation
- **Evidence**:
  ```javascript
  } catch (error) {
    // Empty - errors are silently ignored
  }
  ```

#### 2. Missing Input Validation
**Location**: Invoice tax calculation endpoints
- **Issue**: No bounds checking on tax rates
- **Impact**: Negative or >100% tax possible

### Firestore Rules & Indexes

#### 1. Missing Security Rules
**Location**: `firestore.rules`
- **Critical**: No rules for `employees` and `assignments` collections
- **Impact**: Unrestricted read/write access
- **Required Rules**:
  ```javascript
  match /employees/{document} {
    allow read: if isAuthenticated() &&
                   hasCompanyAccess(resource);
    allow write: if isAuthenticated() &&
                    isAdminOrManager() &&
                    hasCompanyAccess(resource);
  }

  match /assignments/{document} {
    allow read: if isAuthenticated() &&
                   (hasCompanyAccess(resource) ||
                    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid);
    allow write: if isAuthenticated() &&
                    isAdminOrManager() &&
                    hasCompanyAccess(resource);
  }
  ```

#### 2. Missing Composite Indexes
**Location**: `firestore.indexes.json`
- **Issue**: New queries without indexes will fail in production
- **Required**: Indexes for employee status queries, assignment date ranges

### Test Coverage Gaps

#### Critical Missing Tests
1. **Employee Management**: 0 tests
   - Phone validation (E.164 format)
   - Status transitions
   - Role permissions

2. **Job Assignments**: 0 tests
   - Multi-worker selection
   - Shift overlap detection
   - Duration calculations

3. **Worker Schedule**: 0 tests
   - Real-time stream updates
   - Filter logic (today/week/all)
   - Timezone handling

4. **Invoice Workflows**: Partial coverage
   - Missing: Tax calculation edge cases
   - Missing: Status transition validation
   - Missing: Payment recording

## Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate (P0 - Deploy Blockers)
1. **Add Firestore security rules** for employees/assignments
2. **Fix floating-point math** in invoices (use integer cents)
3. **Add input validation** for tax rates (0-100% bounds)

### Short-term (P1 - This Sprint)
1. **Standardize on go_router** - Remove all Navigator.pushNamed calls
2. **Add critical test coverage** for new features (minimum 60%)
3. **Implement proper logging** - Replace print statements
4. **Fix admin dashboard providers** - Simplify dependency chain

### Medium-term (P2 - Next Sprint)
1. **Add comprehensive integration tests** for invoice workflow
2. **Implement retry logic** for Firestore writes
3. **Add monitoring for navigation errors**
4. **Create provider best practices guide**

## Appendix: Testing Recommendations

### Unit Test Priority
1. `InvoiceCalculator` - Test precision, edge cases
2. `EmployeeValidator` - Phone format, status rules
3. `AssignmentService` - Overlap detection, duration math
4. `TaxCalculator` - Bounds, precision, currency

### Integration Test Priority
1. Complete invoice lifecycle (create → send → pay)
2. Employee onboarding flow
3. Worker schedule real-time updates
4. Multi-role permission scenarios

### E2E Smoke Tests
1. Admin: Create invoice, assign workers, view dashboard
2. Worker: View schedule, clock in/out
3. Customer: View invoice, make payment
