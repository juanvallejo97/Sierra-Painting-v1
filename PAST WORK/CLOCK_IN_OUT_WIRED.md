# Clock In/Out Flow - WIRED & READY ‚úÖ

**Status:** Complete - Ready for Validation
**URL:** http://localhost:9002
**Date:** 2025-10-12

---

## ‚úÖ **What's Been Implemented**

### **1. Core Clock In Flow**
```
Worker taps "Clock In" ‚Üí
  1. Get GPS location (LocationService)
  2. Auto-select active job from assignments
  3. Generate clientEventId (idempotency)
  4. Call Firebase clockIn function
  5. Refresh active entry provider
  6. Show success toast with entry ID
```

### **2. Core Clock Out Flow**
```
Worker taps "Clock Out" ‚Üí
  1. Get GPS location (LocationService)
  2. Get active time entry
  3. Generate clientEventId (idempotency)
  4. Call Firebase clockOut function
  5. Refresh active entry provider
  6. Show success/warning toast
```

### **3. Providers Created**
- `activeJobProvider` - Auto-selects worker's active job
- `activeEntryProvider` - Gets current clocked-in entry
- Both use custom claims for companyId (no extra Firestore reads)

### **4. Error Handling**
- GPS accuracy validation
- Geofence violations ‚Üí user-friendly messages
- No job assigned ‚Üí clear error
- Already clocked in ‚Üí prevents duplicates
- Network errors ‚Üí generic fallback

## üìã **Validation Tests - Ready to Execute**

### **Test 1: Clock In (Inside Geofence)** ‚è∏Ô∏è
1. Open http://localhost:9002
2. Login as WORKER (UID: d5POlAllCoacEAN5uajhJfzcIJu2)
3. **Allow location when prompted**
4. Tap "Clock In" button
5. **Expected:**
   - Success toast with entry ID
   - Status changes to "Currently Working"
   - Button changes to orange "Clock Out"
6. **Capture:** Entry ID from toast

---

### **Test 2: Idempotency** ‚è∏Ô∏è
1. While still clocked in, tap "Clock In" again
2. **Expected:**
   - Same entry ID returned
   - Toast: "Already clocked in" OR same ID
   - No duplicate entry created
3. **Verify in Firestore:** Only 1 entry for this user

---

### **Test 3: Clock Out (Outside Geofence)** ‚è∏Ô∏è
1. **Mock location to outside geofence:**
   - Browser DevTools ‚Üí Sensors ‚Üí Geolocation
   - Set to: lat 37.800, lng -122.500 (outside job fence)
2. Tap "Clock Out"
3. **Expected:**
   - Orange warning toast with distance info
   - Successfully clocked out
   - Entry flagged for review
4. **Verify in Firestore Console:**
   - Navigate to `/timeEntries/<entry-id>`
   - Check: `exceptionTags: ["geofence_out"]`

---

### **Test 4: Bulk Approve** ‚è∏Ô∏è
1. Logout, login as ADMIN (UID: yqLJSx5NH1YHKa9WxIOhCrqJcPp1)
2. Navigate to Exceptions tab (if available)
3. Select geofence exception entry
4. Tap "Approve"
5. **Expected:**
   - Success toast
   - Entry removed from exceptions list
   - Badge count decreases
6. **Verify in Firestore:**
   - Entry has: `approved: true`, `approvedBy: admin-uid`
   - Audit log entry created

---

### **Test 5: Create Invoice from Time** ‚è∏Ô∏è
1. Still logged in as admin
2. Select approved time entry
3. Tap "Create Invoice"
4. Enter rate: $50/hour
5. **Expected:**
   - Invoice created with calculated amount
   - Time entry locked with invoiceId
6. **Verify in Firestore:**
   - `/invoices/<id>` exists with correct amount
   - `/timeEntries/<id>` has `invoiceId` field

---

### **Test 6: Auto-Clockout (CLI)** ‚úÖ ALREADY DONE
```bash
# Result from earlier:
{
  "processed": 0,
  "entries": [],
  "dryRun": true
}
```

---

## üîß **Implementation Notes**

### **Files Modified:**
1. `lib/features/timeclock/presentation/worker_dashboard_screen.dart`
   - Wired _handleClockIn() with real API calls
   - Wired _handleClockOut() with real API calls
   - Added imports for services/providers

2. `lib/features/timeclock/presentation/providers/timeclock_providers.dart`
   - Added activeJobProvider (auto-select)
   - Added activeEntryProvider (current clock-in)
   - Uses custom claims for companyId

3. `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`
   - Added userRoleProvider
   - Added userCompanyProvider

### **Services Used:**
- `LocationServiceImpl` - GPS location
- `TimeclockApiImpl` - Firebase function calls
- `Idempotency` - clientEventId generation

### **Known Limitations (OK for validation):**
- Location permission primer not implemented (browser handles)
- No location accuracy warning UI
- Job selection UI missing (auto-selects single job)
- Device ID is mock for web (timestamp-based)

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Execute Tests 1-5** via Flutter app
2. **Capture artifacts:**
   - Entry IDs
   - Toast screenshots
   - Firestore verification screenshots
3. **Post results** using template from VALIDATION_READY.md
4. **If GREEN ‚Üí Stamp STAGING: GO** üöÄ
