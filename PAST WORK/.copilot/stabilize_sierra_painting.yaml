  Comprehensive stabilization configuration for Sierra Painting v1 project.
  Defines CI/CD stability requirements, dependency management strategy,
  workflow standardization, and operational reliability guidelines.

  This configuration focuses on:
  - CI/CD workflow reliability and consistency
  - Dependency version management and pinning
  - Build reproducibility and caching
  - Testing infrastructure stability
  - Deployment safety and rollback procedures
  - Monitoring and alerting setup

stabilization_goals:

    - "100% deterministic builds (same code = same artifacts)"
    - "Sub-60-second rollback capability for all deployments"
