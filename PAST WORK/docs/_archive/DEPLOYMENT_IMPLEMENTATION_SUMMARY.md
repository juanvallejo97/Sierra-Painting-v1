# Deployment and Rollbacks Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of deployment and rollback requirements for the Sierra Painting project, ensuring safe releases that are reversible within minutes with canary-first approach and automated verification.

## Requirements Met

### ✅ Multi-Environment Targets

**Requirement**: "multi-env targets: dev, staging, prod (separate projects or aliases)"

**Implementation**:
- Updated `.firebaserc` with three environment aliases:
  - `dev`: sierra-painting-dev
  - `staging`: sierra-painting-staging  
  - `production`: sierra-painting-prod
- Added hosting targets for each environment
- Created unified deployment script supporting all environments: `scripts/deploy/deploy.sh`

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh --env dev
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh --env staging
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh --env prod
```

**Files Modified**:
- `.firebaserc` - Added dev environment and hosting targets

### ✅ Canary Deployment

**Requirement**: "canary: percent-based or header-based routing (where applicable)"

**Implementation**:
- Existing canary deployment scripts support 10% → 50% → 100% rollout:
  - `scripts/deploy_canary.sh` - Deploy at 10%
  - `scripts/promote_canary.sh` - Promote to 50% or 100%
- Enhanced `CANARY_QUICKSTART.md` with:
  - Multi-environment deployment procedures
  - SLO monitoring guidelines
  - Key user journey verification
- Added automated verification script: `scripts/deploy/verify.sh`

**Usage**:
```bash
# Deploy canary (10%)
./scripts/deploy_canary.sh --project sierra-painting-prod --tag v1.2.0

# Monitor and verify
./scripts/deploy/verify.sh --env prod

# Promote to 50%
./scripts/promote_canary.sh --project sierra-painting-prod --stage 50

# Promote to 100%
./scripts/promote_canary.sh --project sierra-painting-prod --stage 100
```

**Files Modified**:
- `CANARY_QUICKSTART.md` - Enhanced with verification procedures and multi-env support

### ✅ Pre-Deploy Hooks

**Requirement**: "pre-deploy hooks: run smoke tests; block on failures"

**Implementation**:
- Added `predeploy` hook to `firebase.json` for hosting
- Created `scripts/deploy/pre-deploy-checks.sh` script that:
  - Runs smoke tests
  - Checks feature flag configuration
  - Validates database migrations
  - Verifies security rules tests
  - Checks functions build status
  - Validates rollback documentation
- Script blocks deployment on critical failures

**Usage**:
```bash
# Runs automatically during firebase deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Or run manually
./scripts/deploy/pre-deploy-checks.sh staging
```

**Files Modified**:
- `firebase.json` - Added predeploy hook for hosting
- `scripts/deploy/pre-deploy-checks.sh` - New pre-deploy validation script

### ✅ Feature Flags

**Requirement**: "feature_flags: server-driven flags for risky features"

**Implementation**:
- Existing feature flag management via `scripts/remote-config/manage-flags.sh`
- Pre-deploy checks verify feature flag configuration
- Verification script includes feature flag status
- Documentation for instant rollback via feature flags

**Usage**:
```bash
# List flags
./scripts/remote-config/manage-flags.sh list --project sierra-painting-prod

# Enable/disable feature (instant rollback)
./scripts/remote-config/manage-flags.sh disable feature_name --project sierra-painting-prod
```

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/deploy/pre-deploy-checks.sh` - Added feature flag verification

### ✅ One-Command Rollback

**Requirement**: "one-command rollback scripted; artifacts retained for quick revert"

**Implementation**:
- Existing `scripts/rollback.sh` provides one-command rollback:
  - Traffic split method (< 5 minutes)
  - Full redeploy method (~10 minutes)
- Deployment history tracked in `.deployment-history/`
- Git tags retained for version rollback
- Feature flags for instant rollback

**Usage**:
```bash
# Quick rollback (traffic split)
./scripts/rollback.sh --project sierra-painting-prod

# Full rollback (redeploy from tag)
./scripts/rollback.sh --project sierra-painting-prod --method redeploy --version v1.1.0

# Instant rollback (feature flag)
./scripts/remote-config/manage-flags.sh disable feature_name --project sierra-painting-prod
```

**Verification**:
- Rollback scripts already exist and functional
- Deployment history directory exists
- Git tags available for version control

### ✅ Database Migration Reversibility

**Requirement**: "DB migrations reversible or with backfill scripts"

**Implementation**:
- Created `DB_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive guidelines:
  - Three-phase deployment pattern (Expand → Backfill → Contract)
  - Reversible migration patterns
  - Safe backfill script templates
  - Rollback procedures for various scenarios
- Pre-deploy checks validate migration documentation
- Migration checklist included

**Key Patterns Documented**:
1. Adding fields (additive, safe)
2. Renaming fields (three-phase)
3. Changing types (three-phase)
4. Restructuring data (shadow write)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Check for migrations before deploying
./scripts/deploy/pre-deploy-checks.sh prod

# Refer to guide for migration patterns
cat DB_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
```

**Files Created**:
- `DB_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete database migration guide

### ✅ SLO Probes and Verification

**Requirement**: "verification: SLO probes; key journeys (login, estimate create, invoice export)"

**Implementation**:
- Created `scripts/deploy/verify.sh` for automated post-deploy verification:
  - **SLO Probes**:
    - Function availability check
    - Error rate monitoring (< 2% staging, < 1% prod)
    - P95 latency monitoring (< 3s staging, < 2s prod)
    - Cold start time monitoring (< 5s)
  - **Key User Journeys**:
    - Login journey (signup, login, logout, token refresh)
    - Estimate creation (create, add items, calculate, save)
    - Invoice export (convert, generate PDF, mark sent, record payment)
- Generates verification reports in `.deployment-history/`
- Integrated into CI/CD workflows

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run verification after deployment
./scripts/deploy/verify.sh --env prod

# Quick verification (< 5 min)
./scripts/deploy/verify.sh --env prod --quick

# Full verification suite
./scripts/deploy/verify.sh --env prod --full
```

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/deploy/verify.sh` - Post-deployment verification script

### ✅ Post-Deploy Dashboard Links

**Requirement**: "post-deploy dashboard link in release notes"

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflows to include dashboard links:
  - Firebase Console
  - Cloud Functions
  - Logs
  - Error Reporting
  - Performance Monitoring
  - Crashlytics
- Verification script outputs dashboard links
- Deployment scripts include monitoring URLs
- Added to `VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`

**Dashboard Links Included**:
- Firebase Console: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/{PROJECT_ID}`
- Functions: `https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list?project={PROJECT_ID}`
- Logs: `https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query?project={PROJECT_ID}`
- Errors: `https://console.cloud.google.com/errors?project={PROJECT_ID}`
- Performance: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/{PROJECT_ID}/performance`
- Crashlytics: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/{PROJECT_ID}/crashlytics`

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/staging.yml` - Added post-deployment verification and dashboard links
- `.github/workflows/production.yml` - Added post-deployment verification and dashboard links
- `VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Added monitoring dashboard checklist
