## üîÑ Update (Post Phase 2 Consolidation)

As part of Phase 2 cleanup (V1 Ship-Readiness Plan):
- `flutter_ci.yml` was **consolidated back into** `ci.yml` for better maintainability
- The new `ci.yml` provides comprehensive coverage with matrix builds for all platforms
- This reduces workflow duplication and simplifies the CI pipeline
- See `docs/_archive/Plan.md` for the complete consolidation strategy
