# CI/CD Enhancement Verification Checklist

## Overview

This checklist verifies that all requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented.

## Problem Statement Requirements

### ✅ Objectives

- [x] **Fast, reliable pipelines; ephemeral, env-aware**
  - Comprehensive caching implemented (Flutter pub, Gradle, Node modules)
  - All jobs run in clean ephemeral Ubuntu containers
  - Environment-specific workflows (staging auto, production manual)

- [x] **Policy-as-code gates wired to modules**
  - Matrix builds across Flutter, Functions, WebApp
  - Required status checks enforced via branch protection
  - All modules validated before merge

### ✅ Checks

- [x] **cache_strategy: Flutter pub cache + node_modules caching with keyed hashes**
  - `pub-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/pubspec.lock') }}`
  - `gradle-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}`
  - Built-in npm caching with `cache-dependency-path`

- [x] **matrix_builds: android, ios (lint/build only), web**
  - Android: Full build with APK
  - iOS: Lint and analyze (Linux limitation)
  - Web: Full build with size validation
  - Parallel execution with `fail-fast: false`

- [x] **emulator_tests: Firestore rules + Functions integration on PRs**
  - `rules-test` job: Firestore security rules validation
  - `functions-test` job: Full emulator stack (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage)
  - Runs on every pull request

- [x] **artifact_retention: 14 days; sbom: on release**
  - All artifacts: 14-day retention
  - Release builds: 90-day retention
  - SBOM: `flutter pub deps --json > sbom-flutter.json`

- [x] **branch_protection: require checks, signed commits optional, linear history**
  - Documentation: `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`
  - Required checks: analyze, test, rules-test, functions-test, build, web-budget
  - Linear history: Enforced (squash/rebase only)
  - Signed commits: Documented as optional

### ✅ Autofixes

- [x] **Add jobs: analyze, test, build-web-budget, rules-test, functions-test, size-report**
  - `analyze`: Flutter, Functions, WebApp (matrix)
  - `test`: Flutter, Functions (with coverage)
  - `build-web-budget`: 10MB limit enforcement
  - `rules-test`: Firestore rules validation
  - `functions-test`: Cloud Functions integration
  - `size-report`: APK/web size tracking

- [x] **Failure triage: upload logs, flamecharts, and size diffs to artifacts**
  - Script: `scripts/ci/failure-triage.sh`
  - Collects: logs, system info, coverage, sizes, diffs
  - Auto-uploads on failure with 14-day retention

- [x] **Nightly job: docs link checker + dependency audit**
  - Workflow: `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`
  - Link checker: markdown-link-check
  - Dependency audits: npm, Flutter packages
  - License compliance checking
  - Runs daily at 2 AM UTC

### ✅ Release Gates

- [x] **staging deploy auto on main merge; manual promotion to prod with canary**
  - Staging: Auto-deploy on `main` push
  - Production: Manual approval via GitHub Environment
  - Canary: Documentation and scripts provided
    - `scripts/deploy_canary.sh`
    - `scripts/promote_canary.sh`
    - `docs/ops/CANARY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

- [x] **require: VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md satisfied and attached to release**
  - Check added to production workflow setup job
  - Fails build if VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md is missing
  - Documentation updated with requirement
