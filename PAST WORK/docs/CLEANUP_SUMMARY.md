# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This cleanup consolidated the Sierra Painting repository documentation from a sprawling collection of 80+ markdown files into a clean, maintainable structure with 7 canonical documents and an organized archive.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Canonical Documentation

Seven comprehensive guides now serve as the single source of truth:

| Document | Purpose | Merged From |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | Deployment, rollout, and rollback procedures | DEPLOYMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, CANARY_QUICKSTART.md, deployment_checklist.md, rollout-rollback.md |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System architecture and design | ARCHITECTURE.md (root), IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md |
| `docs/DATABASE.md` | Schema, indexes, migrations, optimization | DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md, DB_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md, MIGRATION_TO_OIDC.md |
| `docs/OPERATIONS.md` | Runbooks, monitoring, incident response | OPERATIONS.md (root) |
| `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` | Local setup, code style, workflow | DEVELOPER.md, CONTRIBUTING.md |
| `docs/Security.md` | Security policies, rules, threat model | Already comprehensive (kept as-is) |
| `docs/Testing.md` | Testing strategy and guidelines | Already comprehensive (kept as-is) |

### 2. Archived Historical Documentation

Moved 59 files to `docs/_archive/` with clear organization:

**Categories**:
- Deployment & Migration (12 files)
- Security (7 files)
- Architecture & Implementation (8 files)
- Operations & Performance (8 files)
- Development & CI/CD (8 files)
- Quality & Testing (6 files)
- Project Management (10 files)

All archived content remains accessible for reference and audit purposes.

### 3. Rewrote README

**Before**: 591 lines with redundant content  
**After**: 277 lines (53% reduction)

**New Focus**:
- Executive summary for stakeholders
- Quick 3-command setup
- Clear links to canonical docs
- Production deployment info
- Security disclosure process

### 4. Added CI/CD Hygiene Check

New `repo-hygiene.yml` workflow enforces:
- ✅ Only allowed markdown files in root
- ✅ No secrets in documentation
- ✅ Required canonical docs present
- ✅ Basic link validation

### 5. Root Directory Cleanup

**Before**: 30+ markdown files  
**After**: 3 markdown files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

**90% reduction** in root directory noise.

## Migration Tips

### Finding Old Content
1. Check the canonical docs first (likely consolidated there)
2. Search `docs/_archive/` for the old filename
3. Use `git log` to see when/why files were moved

### Updating External Links
If you have external documentation or wikis linking to moved files:

**Old**: `https://github.com/.../blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md`  
**New**: `https://github.com/.../blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Old**: `https://github.com/.../blob/main/DEPLOYMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`  
**New**: `https://github.com/.../blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (content merged)

### Searching Archived Content
```bash
# Search all archived docs
grep -r "search term" docs/_archive/

# Find specific file in archive
find docs/_archive/ -name "*PATTERN*.md"

# View archived file content
cat docs/_archive/FILENAME.md
```

## Validation Checklist

✅ All required canonical docs present  
✅ No unauthorized markdown in root  
✅ Functions typecheck passes  
✅ Functions lint passes  
✅ Archive README created  
✅ CI hygiene workflow added  
✅ README rewritten (277 lines)  
✅ 59 files archived  
✅ All content preserved  

## Next Steps

1. **Team Review**: Have team review canonical docs for accuracy
2. **Link Updates**: Update any external links to moved files
3. **Training**: Brief team on new structure in standup
4. **Monitor**: Watch CI for hygiene violations
5. **Iterate**: Add/refine docs as needed

## Questions?

- **"Where did X.md go?"** → Check mapping above or `docs/_archive/`
- **"Can I add a new doc?"** → Yes, but keep root clean (use `docs/`)
- **"What if I need old content?"** → It's all in `docs/_archive/`
- **"Should I update CHANGELOG?"** → Yes, for releases only
