## What Was Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Rules Matrix Test (`functions/src/__tests__/rules_matrix.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Exhaustive security rules testing covering all collections and operations.

**Collections Tested**:
1. `/companies/{companyId}` - Company documents
2. `/estimates/{estimateId}` - Estimate documents
3. `/invoices/{invoiceId}` - Invoice documents
4. `/customers/{customerId}` - Customer documents
5. `/jobs/{jobId}` - Job documents with geofence
6. `/assignments/{assignmentId}` - Worker-to-job assignments
7. `/timeEntries/{id}` - Time entries (function-write only)
8. `/clockEvents/{id}` - Clock events (append-only)
9. `/users/{uid}` - User profile documents

**Operations Tested**: Read, Create, Update, Delete

**Roles Tested**:
- Unauthenticated users
- Staff/Workers
- Managers
- Admins
- Cross-company scenarios

**Test Count**: 52 test cases covering:
- ✅ Authenticated users can read their own company data
- ✅ Authenticated users cannot read other company data
- ✅ Unauthenticated users cannot read anything
- ✅ Staff can create certain resources (customers, assignments)
- ✅ Staff cannot create privileged resources (jobs, invoices)
- ✅ Managers can update most company resources
- ✅ Only admins can delete critical resources
- ✅ Function-write only: No client can write timeEntries
- ✅ Append-only: Workers can create but not update/delete clockEvents
- ✅ Workers cannot manipulate other workers' data
- ✅ Cross-company isolation enforced at all levels

**Key Test Examples**:

```typescript
// Company isolation test
test('Company A admin cannot read Company B job', async () => {
  const adminAContext = testEnv.authenticatedContext(ADMIN_A_UID, {
    company_id: COMPANY_A,
    role: 'admin',
  });

  await assertFails(
    adminAContext.firestore().collection('jobs').doc('job-b').get()
  );
});

// Function-write only test
test('admin cannot update time entry (function-only)', async () => {
  const adminContext = testEnv.authenticatedContext(ADMIN_A_UID, {
    company_id: COMPANY_A,
    role: 'admin',
  });

  await assertFails(
    adminContext
      .firestore()
      .collection('timeEntries')
      .doc('entry-1')
      .update({
        status: 'approved',
      })
  );
});

// Append-only test
test('worker cannot update their clock event (append-only)', async () => {
  const staffContext = testEnv.authenticatedContext(STAFF_A_UID, {
    company_id: COMPANY_A,
    role: 'staff',
  });

  const eventRef = await staffContext
    .firestore()
    .collection('clockEvents')
    .add({
      companyId: COMPANY_A,
      userId: STAFF_A_UID,
      jobId: 'job-1',
      type: 'in',
      clientEventId: 'event-3',
    });

  await assertFails(eventRef.update({ type: 'out' }));
});
```

### 2. Test Runner Scripts

#### Linux/macOS: `tools/rules/test_rules.sh`

**What it does**:
1. Starts Firestore emulator in background
2. Waits for emulator to be ready (polls localhost:8080)
3. Runs all rules tests (`rules_matrix.test.ts` + `timekeeping-rules.test.ts`)
4. Stops emulator
5. Reports pass/fail with color-coded output

**Usage**:
```bash
./tools/rules/test_rules.sh
```

**Features**:
- Automatic emulator lifecycle management
- Retry logic for emulator startup (30 attempts)
- Process cleanup on exit
- Color-coded output
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

#### Windows: `tools/rules/test_rules.ps1`

**What it does**: Identical functionality to bash script, using PowerShell.

**Usage**:
```powershell
pwsh tools/rules/test_rules.ps1
```

**Features**:
- PowerShell job-based background execution
- Web request polling for emulator readiness
- Force process termination for Java processes
- Color-coded output using Write-Host
- Identical exit code behavior

### 3. Enhanced Firestore Rules Documentation

**File**: `firestore.rules` (updated)

**Added comprehensive documentation block for `/timeEntries/{id}`**:

```
// CRITICAL SECURITY BOUNDARY: Function-Write Only Pattern
//
// DESIGN RATIONALE:
// - Workers cannot manipulate their own time (prevents fraud)
// - Geofence validation happens server-side only (cannot be bypassed)
// - All time entry writes go through Cloud Functions (clockIn/clockOut)
// - Cloud Functions use Admin SDK (bypasses these rules)
//
// IMMUTABILITY GUARANTEE:
// - Once invoiceId field is set, the entry becomes immutable
// - This is enforced in Cloud Functions, not in these rules
// - Reason: Admin SDK bypasses security rules, so server-side enforcement required
// - See: functions/src/timeclock/updateTimeEntry.ts for enforcement logic
//
// READ PERMISSIONS:
// - Workers: Can read only their own entries from their company
// - Admins/Managers: Can read all entries from their company
// - Cross-company reads: Denied (company isolation)
//
// WRITE PERMISSIONS:
// - Client writes: DENIED (all roles)
// - Function writes: Allowed (via Admin SDK, bypasses rules)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Clearly documents the function-write only pattern
- Explains why invoiced immutability cannot be enforced in rules
- References the Cloud Function where server-side enforcement occurs
- Serves as onboarding material for new developers

### 4. Fixed Existing Test (`timekeeping-rules.test.ts`)

**What changed**: Added explicit `host` and `port` configuration to test environment:

```typescript
beforeAll(async () => {
  testEnv = await initializeTestEnvironment({
    projectId: 'demo-timekeeping-rules',
    firestore: {
      host: 'localhost',  // Added
      port: 8080,         // Added
      rules: fs.readFileSync(...),
    },
  });
});
```

**Why this matters**:
- Allows tests to run without `firebase emulators:exec` wrapper
- Explicit configuration is more predictable
- Consistent with `rules_matrix.test.ts`

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Firebase CLI installed: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Firestore emulator configured (firebase.json)

### Quick Start

**Linux/macOS**:
```bash
./tools/rules/test_rules.sh
```

**Windows**:
```powershell
pwsh tools/rules/test_rules.ps1
```

### Manual Run (Without Script)

```bash
# 1. Start Firestore emulator
firebase emulators:start --only firestore &

# 2. Wait for emulator to be ready
# (Check http://localhost:8080)

# 3. Run tests
cd functions
npm test -- --testPathPattern="rules.*test\.ts" --runInBand

# 4. Stop emulator
pkill -f "firebase.*emulators"
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions** (example):
```yaml
- name: Run Rules Matrix Tests
  run: ./tools/rules/test_rules.sh
  timeout-minutes: 5
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emulator fails to start

**Symptoms**:
- Script reports "❌ Emulator failed to start"
- Timeout after 30 retry attempts

**Solutions**:
1. Kill existing emulator processes:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   pkill -f "firebase.*emulators"

   # Windows
   Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -like "*java*" } | Stop-Process -Force
   ```

2. Check if port 8080 is in use:
   ```bash
   netstat -an | grep 8080
   ```

3. Check emulator.log for errors:
   ```bash
   cat emulator.log
   ```

### Issue: Tests fail with "host and port must be specified"

**Symptoms**:
- Test fails before any test cases run
- Error mentions host/port configuration

**Solution**:
Ensure test environment includes host and port:
```typescript
beforeAll(async () => {
  testEnv = await initializeTestEnvironment({
    projectId: 'demo-rules-matrix',
    firestore: {
      host: 'localhost',  // Required
      port: 8080,         // Required
      rules: fs.readFileSync(...),
    },
  });
});
```

### Issue: Tests pass locally but fail in CI

**Symptoms**:
- All tests pass on local machine
- Same tests fail in CI/CD pipeline

**Solutions**:
1. Verify emulator is installed in CI environment:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install Firebase Tools
     run: npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Add explicit wait for emulator:
   ```yaml
   - name: Wait for Emulator
     run: |
       for i in {1..30}; do
         curl -s http://localhost:8080 && break
         sleep 2
       done
   ```

3. Check CI logs for port conflicts

## Critical Security Validations

### 1. Function-Write Only Pattern

**Why it matters**: Workers must not be able to manipulate their own time entries. All time entry mutations go through Cloud Functions with server-side geofence validation.

**Test coverage**: 7 test cases
- ✅ Worker cannot create timeEntry
- ✅ Admin cannot create timeEntry
- ✅ Worker cannot update timeEntry
- ✅ Admin cannot update timeEntry
- ✅ Admin cannot delete timeEntry
- ✅ Worker can read their own timeEntries
- ✅ Admin can read all company timeEntries

**Enforcement**: `allow write: if false;` in firestore.rules

### 2. Append-Only Pattern (clockEvents)

**Why it matters**: Clock events serve as an immutable audit trail. Once created, they cannot be modified or deleted by clients.

**Test coverage**: 4 test cases
- ✅ Worker can create own clockEvent
- ✅ Worker cannot create clockEvent for another worker
- ✅ Worker cannot update clockEvent (even their own)
- ✅ Worker cannot delete clockEvent (even their own)

**Enforcement**: `allow update, delete: if false;` in firestore.rules

### 3. Company Isolation

**Why it matters**: Multi-tenant security boundary. Users from Company A must never access Company B's data.

**Test coverage**: 6 test cases
- ✅ Company A admin cannot read Company B job
- ✅ Company A admin cannot update Company B job
- ✅ Company A admin cannot delete Company B job
- ✅ Company A staff cannot read Company B timeEntry
- ✅ Company A manager cannot access Company B estimate
- ✅ Cross-company queries fail

**Enforcement**: `isCompany(companyId)` checks throughout rules

### 4. Invoiced Immutability

**Why it matters**: Once time entries are invoiced, they must not be modified to ensure billing accuracy and compliance.

**Implementation**: Server-side enforcement in Cloud Functions (Admin SDK bypasses rules)

**Documentation**: Comprehensive comments in firestore.rules explain:
- Why this cannot be enforced in rules
- Where server-side enforcement occurs
- Design rationale for the approach

**Future work**: Implement `updateTimeEntry` Cloud Function with invoiced check (PR-04)

## Next Steps

### For PR-QA03

Based on learnings from PR-QA02, the next QA PR should focus on:

1. **Observability & SLO Gates**: Add latency probes and performance monitoring
2. **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: Track rule evaluation latency
3. **Alerting**: Set up alerts for slow or failing rule evaluations
4. **Metrics Dashboard**: Visualize security rule performance

### For Production

1. Run rules tests on every PR to staging/main branches
2. Add rules coverage reporting to CI pipeline
3. Set up periodic rules tests (daily) to catch drift
4. Document security review process for rules changes
