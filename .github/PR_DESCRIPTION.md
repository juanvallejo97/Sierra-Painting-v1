### Task #8: CI Test Infrastructure ✅

**What**: Eliminated `[core/no-app]` crashes and established CI workflows

**Root Cause**:
- Crashlytics accessed before Firebase init in test mode
- Test harness attempted Firebase initialization causing platform channel errors
- Test detection wasn't reliable without `--dart-define` flag
- Pre-commit hook used incorrect `flutter format` command

**Changes**:
- ✅ Created `lib/core/env/build_flags.dart` with enhanced test detection
- ✅ Guarded all Crashlytics access behind `isUnderTest` flag in `main.dart`
- ✅ Removed Firebase initialization from `test/test_harness.dart`
- ✅ Added `--dart-define=FLUTTER_TEST=true` to test runner scripts
- ✅ Fixed integration test arg passing in PowerShell (`cmd /c`)
- ✅ Stabilized `smoke_login_test.dart` (removed Firebase setup, use `pump` vs `pumpAndSettle`)
- ✅ Fixed pre-commit hook: `dart format` (not `flutter format`)
- ✅ Fixed `router_redirect_test.dart` (aligned with working auth test pattern)
- ✅ Created CI workflows: `tests.yml` and `guard-widget-tests.yml`
- ✅ Added Firebase emulator config with proper async handling

**Files Created**:
- `lib/core/env/build_flags.dart` - Test mode detection
- `lib/core/firebase_emulators.dart` - Emulator connection helper
- `scripts/run_test_local_temp.ps1` - Windows test runner with TEMP isolation
- `scripts/run_integration_with_emulators.ps1` - Integration test runner
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` - CI test workflow with coverage gate (≥60%)
- `.github/workflows/guard-widget-tests.yml` - Prevents Firebase in widget tests
- `integration_test/bootstrap_test.dart` - Firebase emulator smoke test

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/main.dart` - Consolidated Crashlytics guards
- `test/flutter_test_config.dart` - Minimal harness (no Firebase)
- `test/test_harness.dart` - Removed Firebase init
- `test/smoke_login_test.dart` - Stabilized
- `test/widget/router_redirect_test.dart` - Fixed failing test
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Fixed format command
- `.gitignore` - Added test temp directories

**Results**:
- ✅ 68/68 widget tests passing
- ✅ No platform channel errors
- ✅ Tests complete in <12 seconds
- ✅ Coverage file generates successfully
- ✅ Pre-commit hook works correctly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] All tests complete under 2 minutes
- [x] Coverage file generated
- [x] CI workflows created
- [x] Widget tests isolated from Firebase
- [ ] **CI verification**: Awaiting push to verify workflows green
