- ✅ Consent-gated (GDPR compliant)
- ✅ Web platform detection (Crashlytics N/A on web)
- ✅ User context enrichment (uid, email, orgId)

**Files**: `lib/core/telemetry/telemetry_service.dart`, `lib/core/telemetry/error_tracker.dart`

**Task #4: Invoice/Estimate Creation**
- ✅ Domain models with Firestore serialization
- ✅ Repositories with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Create buttons wired with companyId from custom claims
- ✅ Authentication checks and error feedback
- ✅ Result pattern for type-safe error handling

- ✅ Integrated into TimeclockRepository
- ✅ Replaces hardcoded `isOnline ?? true`

**Files**: `lib/core/services/network_status.dart`, `lib/features/timeclock/data/timeclock_repository.dart`

**Task #8: CI Test Infrastructure**
- ✅ Fixed `[core/no-app]` crashes (Crashlytics guards)
- ✅ Created `build_flags.dart` for reliable test detection
- ✅ Test duration: 180s+ timeout → <20s ✅
- ✅ CI workflows: `tests.yml`, `guard-widget-tests.yml`
- ✅ Pre-commit hook fixed (`dart format` not `flutter format`)

**Files**:
- `lib/core/env/build_flags.dart`
- `lib/main.dart` (Crashlytics guards)
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- `.github/workflows/guard-widget-tests.yml`

### Stage 1: Security Foundation ✅

**Task #6: setUserRole Integration Tests** (40+ test cases)
- ✅ Authentication & Authorization tests
- ✅ Input validation (Zod schema)
- ✅ Firestore document updates (merge mode)
- ✅ Audit log creation and verification
- ✅ Custom claims setting (verified via Firestore)
- ✅ Edge cases (idempotent, admin promotion)
- ✅ Error handling (non-existent users)

**Files**: `functions/src/auth/__tests__/setUserRole.integration.test.ts` (568 lines)

**Task #7: Firestore Rules Tests** (25+ test cases)
- ✅ Tenant isolation (company-scoped access)
- ✅ Invoice RBAC (admin/manager/staff/crew permissions)
- ✅ Estimate RBAC (role-based creation/updates)
- ✅ Owner-based field restrictions
- ✅ Cross-tenant access denial

**Files**: `functions/src/test/rules.test.ts` (+573 lines)

**Task #7: Storage Rules Tests** (30+ test cases)
- ✅ Profile images (user-owned uploads)
- ✅ Project images (admin-only)
- ✅ Estimate/Invoice PDFs (admin-only)
- ✅ Job site photos (crew assignment validation)
- ✅ File type validation (images, PDFs)
- ✅ File size limits (10MB enforcement)

**Files**: `functions/src/test/storage-rules.test.ts` (576 lines)

**CI/CD Enhancements**:
- ✅ Added `rules-tests` job (Firestore, Storage, setUserRole)
- ✅ Increased coverage gate from 20% to 40%
- ✅ All tests run against Firebase emulators

---

## 🔒 Security Impact

**Positive Changes**:
