```

**Assessment:**
- Follows clean architecture principles
- Clear separation of concerns
- Feature modules are self-contained
- Design system is centralized and reusable

### 2. Haptic Service Analysis

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND CORRECT**

The problem statement expressed concern about a missing `hapticServiceProvider`, but analysis shows:

**File: `lib/core/services/haptic_service.dart`**
- ✅ Service class properly implemented
- ✅ Provider correctly defined: `final hapticServiceProvider = Provider<HapticService>((ref) => HapticService(ref))`
- ✅ Settings provider for global enable/disable
- ✅ Five feedback intensities: light, medium, heavy, selection, vibrate
- ✅ Comprehensive inline documentation

**Usage:**
- ✅ Login screen: Uses haptic feedback on button press, validation, success, error
- ✅ Navigation: Uses selection haptic on tab changes
- ✅ Settings: Provides toggle for accessibility

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ `test/core/services/haptic_service_test.dart` exists
- ✅ 15 test cases covering all scenarios
- ✅ Tests enable/disable functionality
- ✅ Tests all feedback intensities

**Conclusion:** Haptic service is production-ready and properly integrated.

### 3. Import Path Analysis

**Score: 9/10**

**Issue Found:**
```dart
// File: lib/features/settings/presentation/settings_screen.dart
// Line 3
import '../../../core/services/haptic_service.dart';  // ❌ Relative import
```

**Should be:**
```dart
import 'package:sierra_painting/core/services/haptic_service.dart';  // ✅ Package import
```

**Impact:** Low - code works but violates style guidelines

**Recommendation:** Fixed in this audit

**All Other Files:** ✅ Properly use package imports

### 4. Dependencies Analysis

**Score: 8/10**

**pubspec.yaml Analysis:**

```yaml
version: 1.0.0+1  # ✅ Proper semantic versioning (NOT 0.0.0!)

environment:
  sdk: '>=3.8.0 <4.0.0'  # ✅ Modern Dart version

dependencies:
  flutter_riverpod: ^3.0.1  # ✅ Latest Riverpod
  firebase_core: ^4.1.1     # ✅ Current Firebase
  go_router: ^16.2.4        # ✅ Modern routing
  # ... 20+ well-chosen dependencies
```

**Dependency Overrides:**
```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  material_color_utilities: 0.5.0  # Needed for integration_test
  analyzer: ^6.4.1                  # Needed for build_runner
```

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Overrides are necessary and justified
- ✅ No version conflicts
- ✅ All dependencies actively maintained
- ⚠️ Override rationale was undocumented (now fixed)

**Dev Dependencies:**
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  very_good_analysis: ^6.0.0   # ✅ Strict linting
  dart_code_metrics: ^5.7.6    # ✅ Code quality metrics
  mockito: ^5.4.4              # ✅ Testing support
```

### 5. Firebase Integration

### 6. State Management

**Score: 10/10**

**Riverpod Implementation:**
- ✅ Consistent use throughout codebase
- ✅ No mixing with Provider package (fully migrated)

**Examples:**
```dart
// Service provider
final hapticServiceProvider = Provider<HapticService>((ref) {
  return HapticService(ref);
});

// State provider
final hapticEnabledProvider = StateProvider<bool>((ref) => true);

// Auth provider
final currentUserProvider = StreamProvider<User?>((ref) {
  return ref.watch(firebaseAuthProvider).authStateChanges();
});
```
