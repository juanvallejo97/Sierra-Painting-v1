  Comprehensive update management configuration for Sierra Painting v1 project.
  Defines standards for dependency updates, version management, security patching,
  and keeping the project current with latest stable releases.

  This configuration focuses on:
  - Dependency update strategy and cadence
  - Security vulnerability remediation
  - Breaking change management
  - Version compatibility testing
  - Documentation of changes and migrations
