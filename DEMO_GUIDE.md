  - `assignments` - Links workers to jobs with shifts
  - `jobs` - Existing collection

### Domain Models

- **Employee:** New model with phone, email, role, status, uid
- **Assignment:** Existing model with startDate, endDate, notes

### Real-time Features
- Worker schedule uses Firestore streams
- Auto-updates when admin creates assignments
- No polling required

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Required Firestore Rules

```javascript
// Add to firestore.rules

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Invoices
    match /invoices/{invoiceId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.token.companyId == resource.data.companyId;
      allow create, update: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.token.role in ['admin', 'manager'];
    }

    // Employees
    match /employees/{employeeId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.token.companyId == resource.data.companyId;
      allow create, update: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.token.role in ['admin', 'manager'];
    }

    // Assignments
    match /assignments/{assignmentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null &&
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId ||
         request.auth.token.role in ['admin', 'manager']);
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.token.role in ['admin', 'manager'];
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Not Implemented (Out of Scope)
1. **Phone Onboarding Flow** - Requires Cloud Functions + SMS integration
   - Employee model supports it (invited status, uid field)
   - Would need:
     - Cloud Function to generate invite tokens
     - SMS sending (Twilio or Firebase Extension)
     - Onboarding screen with phone auth

2. **Job Detail Screen** - Route exists but screen not implemented
   - Can navigate to jobs list
   - Can create jobs
   - Can assign workers
   - Detail view deferred

3. **Worker History Screen** - Commented out in routes
   - Worker can see schedule
   - History/timesheet details deferred

4. **Advanced Features:**
   - Dispute dialog for geofence issues (stub in place)
   - Invoice PDF generation
   - Email notifications
   - Push notifications for assignments

## 📱 Responsive Design

All screens work on:
- ✅ Desktop web browsers
- ✅ Tablet (responsive layouts)
- ✅ Mobile web (touch-friendly)
- ⚠️ Native mobile apps (not tested but should work)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

If build fails with missing files:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build web --release --no-wasm-dry-run
```

### Firestore Permission Denied

If you get permission errors:
1. Check Firebase console → Firestore → Rules
2. Ensure rules allow read/write for authenticated users
3. Verify custom claims (role, companyId) are set

### Real-time Updates Not Working

If worker schedule doesn't update:
1. Check Firestore console for assignment docs
2. Verify companyId matches user's claim
3. Verify userId matches worker's Firebase Auth UID
4. Check browser console for errors
