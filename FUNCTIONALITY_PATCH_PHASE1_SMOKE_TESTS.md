- [ ] clockOutAt timestamp unchanged
- [ ] HTTP 200 with {ok: true}

**Verify (Firestore Console):**
- [ ] time_entries document has ONE clockOutAt timestamp
- [ ] clockOutClientEventId field matches
- [ ] No duplicate or overwrite

---

### Test 3.4: Concurrent Clock In Requests (Race Condition)

**Platform:** Web, Android, iOS (requires automation script)

**Scenario:** Test transaction atomicity

1. Write test script that sends TWO clockIn requests simultaneously
2. Use different clientEventIds but same userId/companyId
3. Both requests should arrive within ~50ms of each other

**Expected:**
- [ ] ONE request succeeds (creates entry)
